# Human Cell Records - Cancer Classification using SVM

## Project Overview

This project aims to classify human cell records as cancerous or non-cancerous using a Support Vector Machine (SVM) model. The dataset includes various features derived from human cells, which are used to predict the likelihood of cancer.

## Key Features

- **Dataset**: A dataset with features extracted from human cell records is used for classification.
- **Algorithm**: Support Vector Machine (SVM) is employed for its robustness in binary classification tasks.
- **Model Evaluation**: Key metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score are used to assess the model's performance.

## Technologies Used

- **Python**
- **Jupyter Notebook**
- **Scikit-learn**
- **Pandas**
- **NumPy**
- **Matplotlib** for visualizations
